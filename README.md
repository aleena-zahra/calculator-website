# calculator-website
This is a functional website I made in my Introduction to Computer and Technology Lab Class. It is a fully functioning calculator that can be used to add, subtract, multiply,divide or take the modulus of different numbers. 
To use it the buttons on the calculator can be clicked, or the numbers and arithemetic symbols can be typed. 
I also styled the calculator to be pink. 
This was a project that I made after learning about how to use html and css. I only had a primitive knowledge of javascript.
